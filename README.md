# PokeDex



This is a simple app to show the height and weight of the original 150 pokemon from the gameboy games red,yellow,and blue.
This section and project started as a javascript function based app that included the use of buttons to bring up information that was pulled from an external api.
We used the functions in an iife to create a list of buttons that brought the modals up when clicked, touched, and when pressing enter. we also added event listeners to close the modal.
Most of the way through this section and building our app we switched gears, we integrated bootstrap into our application and utilized its built in modal and buttons. thus removing the need for some of the functions that were previously needed. the styling then was done through the css adding the buttons on the page into columns.
the css also allowed for custom styling of the colors and fonts of said buttons. we also utilized the nav bar function in bootstrap. 
finally at the end we added es lint and I also used pretty to fix any errors in the javascript.Once that was completed I minified the javascript and css file to save space and add to the speed of the loading on many devices. 
This is a continued project for me as I want to make it look like the original pokedex from the games , as I learn more I will continue to update it.
